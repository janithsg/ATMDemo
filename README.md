# ATM Console Application

This is just a Simple Console Program to demonstrate the basic functions of an ATM.
Language used here is C language and used a text file to keep records.
Text file has renamed to 'data.db' to make more sense :)

This project was done in the first semester in the degree and was expected to implement basic programming techniques.
